# ES Esslingen Open Source Network Security

This repository contains a collection of information regarding Open Source network security tools. In the files [01_IDS.md](01_IDS.md), [02_SIEM.md](02_SIEM.md), and [03_NAC.md](03_NAC.md) we summarize tools that are available. For each we added the direct link to the installation instructions.
Network security requires interaction between these tools. The integration of IDS and SIEM systems is typically directly implemented. However, NAC systems only include some information of single IDS systems, but not from SIEM systems. Therefore, we added the document [30_PacketFence.md](30_PacketFence.md) to highlight first integration steps between PacketFence and SIEM systems.

The content of this repository is based on the presentation **Open Source Netzwerk Sicherheit** at the *Automation 2022*.
